# Douglas Tenfen's Personal Website

Hey! Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This site is designed to showcase my work, share my knowledge, and connect with others. Although I'm primarily a backend developer, I'm using this project to improve my frontend skills and make constant updates to better represent my professional journey.

## Overview

This website is a simple platform where I share insights, experiences, and personal projects. The goal is to not only demonstrate my development skills but also to continuously evolve my site as I learn and grow in my career.

## Technologies Used

Here are the main technologies and tools I used to build my website:

- Design and Prototyping: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Icons: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react)
- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Styling: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Programming Language: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
